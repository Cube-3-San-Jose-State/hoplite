- Raspberry Pi SSH instructions:
With Pi plugged in and connected to wifi network or wired through ethernet: ```ssh pi@hoplite.local```. See discord channel pins for password.
If that does not work, running ```arp -a``` and trying to ssh with the various IP's that show up with the command ```ssh pi@[ip]```
