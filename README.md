- Raspberry Pi SSH instructions:
With Pi plugged in and connected to wifi network or wired through ethernet, run ```arp -a``` to find Pi's IP. With that, run ```ssh hoplite@[ip]```See discord channel pins for password.

Note: When wired through an ethernet cable, we have seen issues in connecting to certain websites (problem seems to be related to ipv6). Certain websites, notably Github aren't reachable.
